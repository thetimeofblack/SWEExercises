Question:
	Implementation difference on client- and on server-side in comparison 
	to the TCP approach.

Answer:
	The TCP approach is based on a connection oriented link. To initialize 
	the connection, IP and port shall be specified on both client and server
	side. Transmission is possible only after the socket is accepted.

	The UDP approach specify a packet for each transmission. It is possible 
	to decide the IP and port of the destination. For server, port shall be 
	given when constructing the server. For client, it shall be assigned a 
	host by name. And for every packet to be sent, IP and port should be 
	specified even if in this case, the "server calculator", either the server and 
	client has its certain socket.
